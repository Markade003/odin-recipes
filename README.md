# odin-recipes
My first Odin project: Recipes

This is the Odin recipes project. The project aims to demonstrate; repo 
creation on GitHub, cloning repo into local machine, creating a basic 
multi-page website, creating links to other pages, staging and 
committing in git, pushing to GitHub and publishing on GitHub.
